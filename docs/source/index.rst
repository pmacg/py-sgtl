SGTL - Spectral Graph Theory Library
====================================
**SGTL** (Spectral Graph Theory Library) is a Python library which provides several methods
and algorithms from spectral graph theory.

It is designed to be (in rough order of priority) easy to use, easy to extend, and fast. To those familiar with the
implemented algorithms, the `source code <https://github.com/pmacg/py-sgtl>`_ should be clear,
and extendable.

For now the primary purpose of this library is to support research in spectral graph theory, and to support
the development of new spectral algorithms. For this reason, some of the algorithms are not fully optimised in order to
facilitate understanding.

   This project is under active development. If you find any bugs, have any questions, or would like to contribute then
   please feel free to contact the maintainer, whose details are available on the `Github page <https://github.com/pmacg/py-sgtl>`_.
