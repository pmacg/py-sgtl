# SGTL - Spectral Graph Theory Library

**The SGTL library is deprecated and will not be updated. The functionality currently available in SGTL will soon be included in the [STAG](https://github.com/pmacg/stag) library and the corresponding [python package](https://github.com/pmacg/stagpy).**

SGTL is a python library of spectral graph theory methods. The library is still very new and so
there are many features and algorithms missing.

You can install the library with `pip install sgtl`.

## Features
* Lightweight and flexible graph object which can be extended as needed.
* Graph matrices including the Laplacian and Normalised Laplacian
* Spectral clustering method
* Generate graphs from the stochastic block model
* Find the cheeger cut of a graph
